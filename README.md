My personal configuration for various tools I use on my Mac and Linux machines.

## LaTeX
The latex section contains a `.sty` file which serves as a shared file on my
machine for defining custom makros typesetting for various manuscripts. I
usually include it as a shared file using the Texifier configuration.
